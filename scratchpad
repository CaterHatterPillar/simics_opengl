PARAVIRTUALIZATION

At a higher level of abstraction, there is the option of paravirtualization.
By selectively modifying the target system, it is possible to control system attributes and add functionality such as device hardware support, while facilitating advanced functionality such as checkpointing and reverse execution in software.
For graphics acceleration, such a system attribute could be a graphics library or a kernel driver (see Figure \ref{fig:overview}).

Inherent by higher abstraction, paravirtualization is cheap in terms of development costs, and by selectively modifying at the graphics library level, there is no need for users to modify the software they wish to accelerate.
Unfortunately, a paravirtualized graphics library may be troublesome to maintain as the framework evolves.
Furthermore, it requires modification of the simulation target, which may be undesirable for some.
Optimally, the simulator should run an unmodified target, but if high performance is important enough for compromise, paravirtualization at the graphics library level is a good trade-off to delimit required modification.
In this way, the changes are confined to the graphics library.
Thus, what parts of the simulation are modified can easily be described to systems developers.

PROBLEM FORMULATION

Such functionality could simplify debugging, testing, and profiling of applications comprising some GPU-bound workload, leveraging the benefits of using Simics for software and systems development with applications requiring graphics acceleration, e.g. responsive UIs.

PARAVIRTUALIZATION

There are a number of ways to do so, such as relying on PCI~passthrough and similar technologies to grant access to underlying host hardware from within the virtual platform~\masccite[p.~415,~416]{inproceedings:regola:2010}, or utilizing a concept commonly referred to as "paravirtualization" at a higher level of abstraction, e.g., the graphics library.
Paravirtualization is defined as selectively modifying the virtual architecture to enhance scalability, performance, or simplicity~\masccite[p.~165-166]{inproceedings:youseff:2006}.
Effectively, this entails modifying the virtual machine to be similar, but not identical, to host hardware~\masccite[p.~165]{journals:barham:2003}.
As such, one may simplify the virtualization process by neglecting some hardware compatibility~\masccite[p.~1]{inproceedings:youseff:2006}.
